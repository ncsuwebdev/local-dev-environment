Steps to make it happen
=========================================================================

- By default, it will share the Apache docroot (located at /var/www/html) to your local folder of 
/usr/local/htdocs.  You can change that if you'd like in the Vagrantfile.  Just update the 
value for the config.vm.share_folder setting.

You'll need to make the /usr/local/htdocs folder (or whatever you set it to) yourself.

1) Install Vagrant (http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
2) Install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3) In the directory with your server configs run:  'vagrant up'
4) Navigate to 192.168.33.10 and you should be good to go.
5) Optional: Add your cname to point to 192.168.33.10 to your /etc/hosts file (Note: this is required for WRAP to work)

**********************************
Note: For WRAP to work, you must be using host with a cname (i.e. - your-cname.unity.ncsu.edu).

Due to issues with the VM's networking, your "real" IP won't be forwarded to the VM. In order for
WRAP to work correctly, you'll need to make sure you select "1 hour, any address" as the Cookie Type 
when logging in to WRAP.

To hook up Sequel Pro to connect to the DB remotely
=========================================================================
1) Download Sequel Pro (http://www.sequelpro.com/download)
2) Make a new connection (set the following things and leave the rest as the defaults)
        Name:  Vagrant Box (or whatever you want)
        MySQL Host: 127.0.0.1
        Username: root
        SSH Host: 192.168.33.10
        SSH User: vagrant
        SSH Key: ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
        SSH Port: 2222

3) Hit connect!
4) You're done! Use Sequel Pro like a boss.


Connect to the VM with SSH
=========================================================================
- From the directory of your configs, just do 'vagrant ssh'
 
Note: sudo doesn't need a password or anything.  Just do 'sudo -s' and you're good to go.


Rerun the puppet configs without relaunching the VM
=========================================================================
- From the directory of your configs, just do 'vagrant provision'


Anything else 
=========================================================================
- From the directory of your configs, just do 'vagrant -h' for the list of commands available
