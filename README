Steps to make it happen
=========================================================================

1) Install Vagrant (http://downloads.vagrantup.com/)
2) Install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3) In the directory with your server configs run:  'vagrant up'
4) Navigate to localhost:8080 and you should be good to go.

Note: For WRAP to work, you must be using host with a cname (i.e. - your-cname.unity.ncsu.edu:8080).

By default, it will share the Apache docroot (located at /var/www/html) to your 
local /usr/local/htdocs folder.  You can change that if you'd like in the Vagrantfile.  
Just update the value for the config.vm.share_folder setting.


To hook up Sequel Pro to connect to the DB remotely
=========================================================================
1) Download Sequel Pro (http://www.sequelpro.com/download)
2) Make a new connection (set the following things and leave the rest as the defaults)
        Name:  Vagrant Box (or whatever you want)
        MySQL Host: 127.0.0.1
        Username: root
        SSH Host: 127.0.0.1
        SSH User: vagrant
        SSH Key: ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
        SSH Port: 2222

3) Hit connect!
4) You're done! Use Sequel Pro like a boss.


Connect to the VM with SSH
=========================================================================
- From the directory of your configs, just do 'vagrant ssh'
 
Note: sudo doesn't need a password or anything.  Just do 'sudo -s' and you're good to go.


Rerun the puppet configs without relaunching the VM
=========================================================================
- From the directory of your configs, just do 'vagrant provision'


Anything else 
=========================================================================
- From the directory of your configs, just do 'vagrant -h' for the list of commands available
